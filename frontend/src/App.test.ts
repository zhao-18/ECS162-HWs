In order to understand how to write the tests, first we looked at the lab slides, then we had to do some reading from svelte testing documentation and npm documentation. We also read up on documentation in NYT's response fields to help make tests on articles.
Here are the links of the documentation that we used. The tests were succesfully ran on our machines. Check test_proof for screenshots on the passing tests.
